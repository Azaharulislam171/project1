# Product Development
## Introduction to Project Requirements spoken by MyWebClass.org CEO

Greetings, fellow developers! As the CEO of MyWebClass.org, I'm here to talk to you about the most exciting part of our jobs: legal compliance! (insert sarcastic eye roll) 

Now, I know what you're thinking. "But boss, I went into web development to avoid lawyers and paperwork!" Well, tough luck, my friends. We've got to comply with all those pesky regulations and laws if we want to avoid getting sued and keep our website running.

But don't worry, it's not all boring legal stuff. We've also got to make our website accessible to people from all over the world. That means translating everything into Klingon and emoji, right? (pause for laughter) Just kidding, we'll settle for some basic internationalization features.

And speaking of features, we've got to make sure our website is visible on search engines. Otherwise, we'll end up like that one website that nobody visits except for the owner's mom. (insert exaggerated sad face) So let's get our SEO game on and make sure we're the top result for "awesome web development resources"!

But wait, there's more. We've also got to make our website accessible to people with disabilities. Because who needs to see images or hear audio when you can just read text in size 72 font, am I right? (pause for laughter) Okay, I'm kidding again. Let's make our website inclusive and welcoming to everyone.

And don't forget about the most important task of all: choosing the best front-end framework. Will it be HTML, Next.js, Bootstrap, Foundation, or Material Design? It's like the Avengers of web development! (pause for laughter) But seriously, let's evaluate them all and choose the one that meets our needs and impresses our users.

Last but not least, we've got to comply with GDPR regulations and protect our users' privacy. Because we're not just web developers, we're superheroes who fight for justice and data protection!

So let's roll up our sleeves, grab some coffee, and get to work. We've got a website to develop and a world to conquer! (insert inspiring music and dramatic exit)
## Development Requirements 
### 1. Front-End Testing
- Choose three different CSS frameworks and implement the homepage and content page using each one. Also, implement the same pages in plain HTML and CSS.
- Test the performance of Next.js by comparing it to three CSS frameworks and static pages.
- Use Playwright to automate browser testing of the pages that are currently in the project (homepage, content page, story). You will need tests for Next.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and any other version of the site you make.
- Measure the following metrics: page load time, accessibility score, best practices score, first contentful paint (FCP), time to interactive (TTI), total blocking time (TBT), cumulative layout shift (CLS), page size, number of requests, bundle size, overall size, and other relevant statistics.
- Include industry statistics for each of these metrics in your presentation, such as average page load time for websites in the same industry or the ideal score for accessibility and best practices.
### 2. Development Tasks
- Conduct legal research for the website, implement necessary changes, perform testing, and resolve any issues that arise. This will help ensure that your website complies with relevant laws and regulations.
- Conduct research and implement internationalization features for the website, perform testing, and resolve any issues that arise. This will make your website accessible to users from different countries and cultures.
- Conduct SEO research, implement changes, perform testing, and resolve any issues that arise. This will help improve your website's visibility and ranking on search engines.
- Conduct web accessibility research, implement changes, perform testing, and resolve any issues that arise. This will help ensure that your website is accessible to users with disabilities.
- Develop a responsive content template and homepage for the website. This will help ensure that your website is visually appealing and easy to navigate on different devices.
- Implement GDPR requirements with Google Analytics using Consent API and Javascript. This will help ensure that your website complies with relevant data privacy regulations.

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions for each task and pay close attention to any issues that arise during
testing. By completing these tasks, you will ensure that your website is legally compliant, accessible, user-friendly,
and optimized for search engines. Good luck with your project!

# To comply with GDPR when implementing Google Analytics, there are a few steps you can take:

- Obtain user consent: Users must give explicit consent for their data to be collected and processed by Google Analytics. You can achieve this by adding a cookie consent banner to your website that explains what data is being collected and why.

- Anonymize IP addresses: Google Analytics collects IP addresses by default, which is considered personal data under GDPR. To comply with GDPR, you can anonymize IP addresses before they are sent to Google Analytics by adding the following code to your tracking script:

- Disable data sharing: By default, Google Analytics shares data with Google to improve its services. You can disable this by adding the following code to your tracking script:

- Provide an opt-out mechanism: Users should be given the option to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking. You can achieve this by adding an opt-out link or button to your website that allows users to disable tracking.

- It's also important to update your website's privacy policy to include information about the data collected by Google Analytics and how it is used.
